# Facemask_Detection
This project has a HUGE dataset but I made a smaller one out o fit since the uploading of files becomes impossible and extremely time taking, I trained the data with about 600 images divided into two categories and tested with about 800 images and my accuracy touched nearly 90. I used several libraries which are extensively used for machine learning like tensorflow, keras, PIL etc. This is also done in steps but not divided by textboxes. 

**NOTE: whenn predincting, use jpg image not jpeg because that somehow doesn't work with the dataset.
